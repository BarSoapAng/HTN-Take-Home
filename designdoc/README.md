# Pre-development

1. Started by stating out requirements for the UI:
    - Login
    - Each event:
      - name
      - event type
      - start & end time
      - description (truncated)
      - Show more (expand):
        - extended description
        - speakers
        - related events
    - Sorting:
      - by time
      - Bonus: search for name
      - Bonus: by event type
      - Bonus: event reordering, persist across refresh
2. Research existing solutions:
    - Luma (very cutesy, modular, notion vibes)
    - Eventbrite (basic, kinda ugly)
    - Meetup (eventbrite copy, but cuter, more sketchy)
3. Synthesize themes:
    - I want something that has the "sketching" aesthetics Meetup features, but a cooler, modern vibe like Luma.
    - Sharp rectangular sketched frames for each event
    - Doodly but still readable font
    - White/paper background, pops of color, not too colorful though
    - Bonus: bubbly color animation on hover
4. Design!
